Water is not just a drink, but a reminder of the delicate balance that governs our lives.\n\nIts utility is undeniable. We drink it to quench our thirst, to cleanse our bodies of impurities, and to maintain the proper functioning of our bodily systems. The circulatory system, in particular, relies on water to distribute nutrients and oxygen to our cells. Without it, our bodies would soon succumb to dehydration and its attendant problems.\n\nBut water's benefits extend far beyond the physical realm. It has a profound impact on our mental and emotional well-being. A cool glass of water on a hot summer's day can bring us relief and calmness, washing away the stresses of the world. In this sense, water is a symbol of renewal and revitalization.\n\nFurthermore, water's simplicity and availability make it accessible to all, regardless of social status or wealth. It is a reminder that true wealth lies not in material possessions, but in the things that sustain and nourish us.\n\nAs a Stoic, I see water as a metaphor for the fleeting nature of life. Just as water flows effortlessly from one state to another, so too must we learn to adapt and flow with the changing tides of life. We must not cling to things that are ephemeral, but rather find strength in our ability to navigate the uncertain waters of existence.\n\nIn short, water is good for us because it reminds us of the importance of balance, simplicity, and renewal. It teaches us to appreciate the things that truly matter in life, and to find strength in our ability to adapt and flow with the changing circumstances of the world.",

Instead, recall that the incompetent colleague is still a human being, worthy of compassion and understanding. Recognize the imperfections of yourself, also, for they too may be a source of frustration.\n\nConsider the nature of the task at hand, and whether the incompetence is truly a fault of the colleague, or rather a test of your own patience and wisdom. Adjust your expectations, and seek to teach, rather than scold.",
